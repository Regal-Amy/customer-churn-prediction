# Customer Churn Analysis for PowerCo

## Overview
This project analyzes customer churn at PowerCo, a utility provider facing significant challenges due to increased competition in the energy market. The analysis aims to identify the factors contributing to customer churn and suggest actionable strategies for retention.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to determine the underlying reasons for customer churn at PowerCo, with a particular focus on price sensitivity and other potential causes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from PowerCo's customer records, including attributes such as customer demographics, service usage, pricing, and churn status.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn


## Process
1. **Data Cleaning**: The dataset was cleaned to remove missing values and irrelevant features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations were created to understand trends and correlations among variables.
3. **Model Building and Evaluation**: Various models were tested using Random Forest Classifier to predict churn, focusing on feature importance related to price sensitivity and customer satisfaction.

## Results and Insights
The analysis revealed that price sensitivity is a major factor driving customer churn, especially among small businesses. Other contributing factors include:
- Customer service quality
- Contract flexibility

### Recommendations
To address the identified issues, the following strategies are proposed:
- Implement personalized pricing for sensitive segments.
- Enhance customer service quality.
- Offer more flexible contract options.
- Launch targeted retention campaigns and loyalty programs.

## Future Work
Future work could involve deeper analysis into customer segments, enhancing predictive models with additional features, and implementing A/B testing for retention strategies.
