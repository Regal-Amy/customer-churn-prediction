# customer-churn-prediction

This project aims to predict customer churn for PowerCo using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer data such as energy consumption, contract details, and pricing, I built a model using Random Forest Classifier to identify customers at risk of leaving, enabling proactive retention strategies.
